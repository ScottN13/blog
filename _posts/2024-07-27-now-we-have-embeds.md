Hello!
You might've come here from [my website.](https://www.scottnewman.xyz)

On the "Latest News and Updates" section, I have made a pseudo-embed (that's because i don't really count it as one, but make of it what you will.)

I used your typical HTML5 iFrame.
Here's how i did it.

``<iframe src="https://blog.scottnewman.xyz" title="Blog Embed" height="300" width="320" style="border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>``

I've included the `height` and `width` instead of the default size, so that the first recent post can be seen.

As funny as it sounds, `scrolling="no"` actually works.

`* P.S. My website, as well as this blog, are both open sourced on my Github.`
