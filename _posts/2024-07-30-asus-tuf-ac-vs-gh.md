Hello! :wave:
Since at this point, the blog is basically done, I decided to make this post.
While I still have to do the music player, linktree and guestbook (the file repo is a wish, not  must.), I feel like i am still far from done in the process of making an actual website. I want it to have more features and easter eggs ðŸ¤«.

But this is a guide, right? So let us begin!

# What is Armoury Crate?
Armoury Crate was created by ASUS for their ROG and TUF laptop line-ups, later adding support to other products like GPUs, mechanical keyboards and mice, etc.

If you have bought your laptop with Windows pre-installed, it might've come with AC preinstalled.

> Remember, `AC` = Armoury Crate, `GH` = GHelper.

# What is GHelper?
Created by seerge, it was designed to be a lightweight alternative to AC, while giving more control over your settings.

It is open source and it basically supports every device that AC also supports.
It is portable, meaning everything runs on a single executable and you dont need a wizard[^1] to install it.

# So, who's better?
I'll be rating these two apps on 5 categories:
- User-friendliness
- Stability & Performance
- Features
-

## User-friendliness
